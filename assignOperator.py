    Assignment Operator: Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.

    a = 5 is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 5 on the right to the variable a on the left.

    There are various compound operators in Python like a += 5 that adds to the variable and later assigns the same. It is equivalent to a = a + 5.

    =	x = 5	x = 5
    +=	x += 5	x = x + 5
    -=	x -= 5	x = x - 5
    *=	x *= 5	x = x * 5
    /=	x /= 5	x = x / 5
    %=	x %= 5	x = x % 5
    //=	x //= 5	x = x // 5
    **=	x **= 5	x = x ** 5
    &=	x &= 5	x = x & 5
    |=	x |= 5	x = x | 5
    ^=	x ^= 5	x = x ^ 5
    >>=	x >>= 5	x = x >> 5
    <<=	x <<= 5	x = x << 5
